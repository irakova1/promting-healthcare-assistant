1. Calcium: You can find calcium in a variety of foods such as dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt; leafy green vegetables like broccoli, spinach, and kale; and fortified foods like orange juice, soy milk, and cereals. Aim for 1000 mg to 1200 mg of calcium per day.

2. Vitamin D: Since your Vitamin D level is low, you should focus on increasing your intake of this vitamin as well. Good sources include fatty fish like salmon or mackerel, sunlight exposure (but be careful not to overdo it), and fortified foods like milk and orange juice. Aim for a daily intake of 600 IU to 800 IU of Vitamin D if you're under the age of 70 and 1500 IU to 2000 IU if you're over 70 years old.

3. Other bone-friendly nutrients: You can also consume foods rich in other nutrients that support healthy bones, such as magnesium (found in nuts, seeds, and green vegetables), phosphorus (found in dairy products, meats, and legumes), and vitamin K2 (found in eggs).

It's always a good idea to consult your healthcare provider before making any major dietary changes. They can help you determine if these food recommendations are appropriate for your specific situation and provide additional guidance on improving your bone health.","To support bone health and prevent osteoporosis, consider adding calcium-rich foods like dairy products, leafy greens, and fortified cereals to your diet.
